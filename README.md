# Nexusmods-RapidDownloader
Download any preview mod instantly with a click through my extension!
For chromium browsers only for now.
Basically there should now be a green download icon next to mod previews for instant downloading it will choose slow download by default though so not so cool for premium users i guess

Dont forget to endorse mod authors!

Issues:
Download icon is in more than one places near mods previews so it will show up more than once to download the real mod file click on the download symbol near the title of the mod:

Instructions:
Download the zip source and extract it and follow [these(https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/how-to-install-chrome-extensions-manually/)] instructions for loading unpacked extension
Thanks to claude 3.5 sonnet for the help
